Unfortunately we were unsuccessful in compiling this game as a .jar file, JavaFx does not seem to want to work when it comes to it and after spending over four hours on trying to solve this, we got nowhere.

To run this game you will need to download the following tools: https://eclipseide.org/ and https://github.com/apps/desktop.

1. Use Github Desktop to clone our repository or you can download the release.
2. This clone will serve as an “workspace” for Eclipse.
3. Open Eclipse IDE, and select the cloned repository.
4. You will then need to click on File->Import
5. You will select “Existing Maven Project” and select the Game folder.
6. You now have access to the game but due to issues with JavaFX you will have to run it via the Launcher class
